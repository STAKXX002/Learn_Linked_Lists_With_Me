# Learn_Linked_Lists_With_Me

A collection of **menu-driven C programs** to learn and practice linked lists â€” from **single** to **doubly circular** linked lists. Each program demonstrates **all major operations** like insertion, deletion, traversal, reverse, sort, finding min/max, and more.

##  Programs Included

| File | Linked List Type | Features |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| `single_linked_list.c` | Single Linked List | Create, traverse, count, insert (begin/end/position/after element), delete (first/last/position/after element), reverse, find middle, max/min, sort, append |
| `double_linked_list.c` | Doubly Linked List | Same as above with previous pointer support |
| `circular_linked_list.c` | Circular Linked List | Singly circular linked list with all operations |
| `doubly_circular_linked_list.c` | Doubly Circular Linked List | Full doubly circular implementation with all operations |

##  How to Compile and Run

Using **GCC** on Linux / macOS / Windows (with MinGW):

```bash
# Compile any program, for example:
gcc doubly_circular_linked_list.c -o doubly_circular_linked_list

# Run
./doubly_circular_linked_list
